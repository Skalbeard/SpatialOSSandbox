# SpatialOSExperiments
This is a showcase project made in UE4, demonstrating custom physics network replication and multiple collision synchronization.
Features a portal system that teleports physical objects and players and should work in multiplayer.
Set up to run on SpatialOS cloud server.

Using UE4 SpatialOS version 4.26

TODO:
* abstract the network replication into a component
* convert position replication to RPC
* put the portal logic into the portal BP
* consolidate material
* fix multiplayer player rotation on teleport
